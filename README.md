# linked list
###### Charlie Hall

This is an implementation of a linked list that utilizes all features of linked lists, and includes generalizable weighting schemes, specified print and destroy functions for each input, and constant time reversing of the list.
The following functions are the core components of this implementation:

1. [Linked List Creation - `makeLL()`](#create-linked-list)
2. [Linked List Insertion - `insertLL()`](#insert-into-linked-list)
3. [Linked List Peek - `peakheadLL()`](#peek-at-linked-list)
4. [Linked List Pop - `popheadLL()`](#pop-off-linked-list)
5. [Linked List Reverse - `reverseLL()`](#reverse-linked-list)
6. [Linked List Print - `printLL()`](#print-linked-list)
7. [Linked List Destroy - `destroyLL()`](#destroy-linked-list)
